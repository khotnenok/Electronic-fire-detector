# Electronic-fire-detector
In this project, we are creating an electronic device that will detect flame.
In Russia, we have several models of flame detectors, but they use an electronic lamp used as a sensor.
Our goal is to create a simple device with the same functions, but with a solid-state sensor to increase the life of the sensor.
